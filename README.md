A Minecraft shaderpack that recreates the looks and feel of the game Dying Light. It replicates the graphics effects and gameplay features of the original game!

Made by: Antonio (Snurf).

It uses the Optifine shaders mod to allow for developers to write GLSL shaders that use Optifine's rendering pipeline.
